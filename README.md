# new-tracks

### Description

This project is a continuation of my [original SoundCloud project](https://github.com/njscholfield/soundcloud) that displays descriptions of tracks on SoundCloud. It adds a database which allows users to save tracks for later. Users can either create an account or sign in with their SoundCloud account.

From the description of the track, the user can add the track to their list of tracks. If the release date is not included in the track info from the API, the user can add a release date if they want.

Each user has the ability to make their profile public, which allows other people to see the tracks a user has saved.
